# [My place on the WWW! Oh man!][simov]

:alien:

> Let me share a recurring nightmare I have with you. In this dream, I'm sitting down in front of a computer which boots up, running an operating system I've written. I then launch a web browser I've created from scratch, all by myself, and navigate to a website I've constructed. I click on the first link and the whole thing bluescreens. And the bluescreen itself bluescreens and begins to fold in on itself, collapsing into a massive explosion that destroys an entire city block.

> That's the good version of the dream. In the other one, there's just ... screaming. And darkness.
